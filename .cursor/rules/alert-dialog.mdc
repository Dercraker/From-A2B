## Context

* DialogManager enables you to show a global popup with many features. The basic one is just a validation dialog:

## Example

```tsx
import { alertDialog } from "@feat/alert-dialog/alert-dialog-store";

alertDialog.add({
  title: 'Delete step',
  description: 'Are you sure you want to delete this step?',
  loading: {LoadingState},
  confirmText: {entityName},
  action: {
    label: "Delete",
    onClick: async () => {
      await deleteTripAsync();
    },
  },
});
```

## Rules 
* title and description accept react component
* comfirmText is optional
