## Context

* We use NextAuth to handle authentification in our application.
* Our application create helper to simplify the usage of retreiving the user.

## Example

To get the current user, you must use `auth` function :

```ts
import { currentUser, requiredUser } from '@lib/auth/helper';

// user is optional
const user = await currentUser();
// throw an error if user is not defined
const user = await requiredUser();
```

`requiredUser` will throw an `unauthorized` method that will be catch by `unauthorized.tsx`. You can check [nextjs-routes.mdc](mdc:.cursor/rules/nextjs-routes.mdc).
